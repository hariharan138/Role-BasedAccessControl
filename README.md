Role-BasedAccessControl
Overview
This project is a web application that allows user authentication (login/registration), a user dashboard that displays user statistics, and a management interface to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on users. The application is designed to manage users effectively with roles for active and inactive users, settings management, and a secure logout feature.

Features
Login and Registration: Users can register and log in to the platform. Backend validation ensures only valid data is accepted.
User Dashboard: After logging in, users are directed to a dashboard displaying:
Total User Count: Displays the total number of registered users.
Active Users: Displays the count of active users.
Inactive Users: Displays the count of inactive users.
Users Page: The admin can view, edit, add, and delete users.

CRUD Operations:
Create: Add new users to the platform.
Read: View details of users.
Update: Edit user information.
Delete: Remove users from the platform.
Settings Page: Allows users to update account settings (e.g., change password, email).
Logout: A secure logout mechanism that takes the user back to the login page.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js or Vue.js, if using a modern JS framework)
Backend: Node.js with Express.js (or similar backend technology)
Database: MongoDB or MySQL (depending on the choice)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for session management

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (version 14.x or higher)
npm (Node Package Manager)
MongoDB (or another database, depending on your project)
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies for both frontend and backend.

For the Backend (Node.js):
bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
For the Frontend (React.js or other):
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Database Setup
If you're using MongoDB, make sure it's running and accessible.

Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your database credentials, for example:
env
Copy code
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
You can also set up any other necessary configuration for your application (like session secrets or API keys).
Run the Application
Start the Backend Server:
bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Start the Frontend Server:
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Your application should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Login and Registration
When users first access the site, they are prompted to either log in or register.
The registration form requires a valid email, username, and password.
The login form checks the credentials against the backend.

User Dashboard
After successful login, the user is redirected to the Dashboard, where they can see:
Total count of registered users.
Number of active and inactive users.
Users Management Page
The Users Page allows the admin to:
Add new users.
Edit existing users.
Delete users from the system.
CRUD operations are performed through an interactive UI.
Settings Page
Users can update their profile and account settings from the Settings page.
Options like changing password, updating email, etc.
Logout
Users can log out securely, which will redirect them to the login page.

Backend Folder
/models: Contains database models (e.g., User, Session, etc.).
/routes: API routes to handle requests (login, register, etc.).
/controllers: Logic to process requests and interact with models.

Frontend Folder
/src: Main React.js application files.
/components: Reusable React components (e.g., LoginForm, UserCard, etc.).

Future Enhancements
Add role-based access control (admin, user).
Integrate password recovery (forgot password).
Improve error handling and validation.

Troubleshooting
Database Connection Error: Ensure MongoDB is running and the connection string in .env is correct.
